      <p>Naming groups of organisms in a way that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some disputes in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names.<sup id="cite_ref-BrochuSumrall2001_37-0" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-BrochuSumrall2001-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" title="Linnaean taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a> is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a>; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup>
      </p><p>Paleontologists generally use approaches based on <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics" title="Cladistics">cladistics</a>, a technique for working out the evolutionary "family tree" of a set of organisms.<sup id="cite_ref-BrochuSumrall2001_37-1" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-BrochuSumrall2001-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characters that are compared may be <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">anatomical</a>, such as the presence of a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Notochord" title="Notochord">notochord</a>, or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogeny" class="mw-redirect" title="Molecular phylogeny">molecular</a>, by comparing sequences of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of clades&#160;– groups that share a common ancestor. Ideally the "family tree" has only two branches leading from each node ("junction"), but sometimes there is too little information to achieve this and paleontologists have to make do with junctions that have several branches. The cladistic technique is sometimes fallible, as some features, such as wings or <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye" title="Evolution of the eye">camera eyes</a>, evolved more than once, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergently</a>&#160;– this must be taken into account in analyses.<sup id="cite_ref-CowenHistLifeEd3P47To50_36-1" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-CowenHistLifeEd3P47To50-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>
      </p><p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology" title="Evolutionary developmental biology">Evolutionary developmental biology</a>, commonly abbreviated to "Evo Devo", also helps paleontologists to produce "family trees", and understand fossils.<sup id="cite_ref-Tetrop_39-0" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-Tetrop-39">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> For example, the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryological" class="mw-redirect" title="Embryological">embryological</a> development of some modern <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiopod" title="Brachiopod">brachiopods</a> suggests that brachiopods may be descendants of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Halkieriid" title="Halkieriid">halkieriids</a>, which became extinct in the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian" title="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> period.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>
