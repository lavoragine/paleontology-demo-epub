            <b>Paleontology</b> or <b>palaeontology</b>
           is the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene" title="Holocene">Holocene</a> Epoch (roughly 11,700 years <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_present" class="mw-redirect" title="Before present">before present</a>). It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and interactions with each other and their environments (their <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoecology" title="Paleoecology">paleoecology</a>). Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th century BC. The science became established in the 18th century as a result of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier" title="Georges Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>'s work on <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_anatomy" title="Comparative anatomy">comparative anatomy</a>, and developed rapidly in the 19th century. The term itself originates from <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> παλαιός, <i>palaios</i>, "old, ancient", ὄν, <i>on</i> (<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive" class="mw-redirect" title="Genitive">gen.</a> <i>ontos</i>), "being, creature" and λόγος, <i>logos</i>, "speech, thought, study".<sup id="cite_ref-OnlineEtDict_1-0" class="reference"><a href="refs.xhtml#cite_note-OnlineEtDict-1">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p>Paleontology lies on the border between <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology" title="Geology">geology</a>, but differs from <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> in that it excludes the study of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human" class="mw-redirect" title="Anatomically modern human">anatomically modern humans</a>. It now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences, including <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry" title="Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematic" class="mw-redirect" title="Mathematic">mathematics</a>, and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_life" title="Evolutionary history of life">evolutionary history of life</a>, almost all the way back to when <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_years" title="Billion years">billion years ago</a>. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> organisms while others study <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoecology" title="Paleoecology">ecology</a> and environmental history, such as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology" title="Paleoclimatology">ancient climates</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Body fossils and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_fossil" title="Trace fossil">trace fossils</a> are the principal types of evidence about ancient life, and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry" title="Geochemistry">geochemical</a> evidence has helped to decipher the evolution of life before there were organisms large enough to leave body fossils. Estimating the dates of these remains is essential but difficult: sometimes adjacent rock layers allow <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating" title="Radiometric dating">radiometric dating</a>, which provides <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_dating" title="Absolute dating">absolute dates</a> that are accurate to within 0.5%, but more often paleontologists have to rely on relative dating by solving the "<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle" title="Jigsaw puzzle">jigsaw puzzles</a>" of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy" title="Biostratigraphy">biostratigraphy</a>. Classifying ancient organisms is also difficult, as many do not fit well into the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy" title="Linnaean taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a> that is commonly used for classifying living organisms, and paleontologists more often use <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics" title="Cladistics">cladistics</a> to draw up evolutionary "family trees". The final quarter of the 20th century saw the development of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics" title="Molecular phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, which investigates how closely organisms are related by measuring how similar the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> is in their <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genomes</a>. Molecular phylogenetics has also been used to estimate the dates when species diverged, but there is controversy about the reliability of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock" title="Molecular clock">molecular clock</a> on which such estimates depend.
